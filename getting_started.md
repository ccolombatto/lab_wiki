On your ﬁrst morning you will be met by one of the reception team at the FIL. They will arrange for you to have a building induction, introduce you to key people, get your access card and show you to your desk. There are a few things you need to do within your ﬁrst few weeks for both UCL and the lab, see below for a checklist. If there is anything you seem to be missing, please ask Steve or senior lab members and we’ll point you in the right direction.

### General checklist:

* Building induction
* Access card
* IT induction
* Fire safety walkthrough
* Mandatory UCL staﬀ moodle courses
