## Steve expects you to:

* Do work you're proud of, and seek the respect of those who you respect.
* Give yourself time to think and try not to be busy just to seem busy. Amos Tversky tells us that "The secret of doing good research is always to be a little underemployed".
* Be careful and don't rush. Double and triple check your work, and try to incorporate sanity checks in your analyses.
* Be organized, document everything and take notes. Your future self will thank you.
* When we meet, take notes and especially write down any specific action points weâ€™ve agreed on. Not only does this help structure your work, it can also serve as a great reminder for when Steve inevitably contradicts his past self.
* Help others, collaborate and share your ideas and skills. 
* Stay in touch, and take an active part in the life of the lab - checking into Slack, and regularly attending lab meetings
* Ask questions, admit when you are wrong, and know the limits of your knowledge.
