## Steve expects you to:

* Do work you're proud of, and seek the respect of those who you respect.
* Give yourself time to think and try not to be busy just to seem busy. Amos Tversky tells us that "The secret of doing good research is always to be a little underemployed".
* Be careful and don't rush. Double and triple check your work, and try to incorporate sanity checks in your analyses.
* Be organized, document everything and take notes. Your future self will thank you.
* When we meet, take notes and especially write down any specific action points we’ve agreed on. Not only does this help structure your work, it can also serve as a great reminder for when Steve inevitably contradicts his past self.
* Help others, collaborate and share your ideas and skills. 
* Stay in touch, and take an active part in the life of the lab - checking into Slack, and regularly attending lab meetings
* Ask questions, admit when you are wrong, and know the limits of your knowledge.


# Steve does not expect you to:

1. Respond immediately to emails, especially if sent at unusual times. Email is an asynchronous medium, so set your own boundaries (and other fantastic [PhD tips]((https://twitter.com/annegalloway/status/438412389319319552?lang=en)))!
2. Work over weekends and holidays. 

# Steve aspires and promises to:

* Support you in your research and career. He will continually assess my own practices as a mentor and supervisor, and improve his own practices to help you flourish as a scientist and person.

* Respond to questions and give feedback in a timely manner.
  - Steve aims to respond to emails or Slack messages the same or next day. If something is urgent (e.g. a problem with data collection, a sudden deadline for a grant application) he will usually respond more quickly.
  - Papers require more time because they need extended blocks of time in the day to think and write. The aim is to get papers back to you within 2 weeks. If you don’t hear back after that, please do chase as occasionally things do get waylaid.
  - If you need a letter of reference, or other more substantial feedback (eg on a grant application), please give a heads-up a few weeks in advance (e.g. as soon as you know that you’re applying for something). Steve can then block off time to go over your work and give feedback quickly. 

* Create a fun and supportive learning environment.
* Help you form connections with other researchers, write recommendation letters for scholarships, awards, or future positions.
