## I expect you to:

* Do work you're proud of, and seek the respect of those who you respect.
* Give yourself time to think and try not to be busy just to seem busy. Amos Tversky tells us that "The secret of doing good research is always to be a little underemployed".
* Be careful and don't rush. Double and triple check your work, and try to incorporate sanity checks in your analyses.
* Be organized, document everything and take notes. Your future self will thank you.
* When we meet, take notes and especially write down any specific action points we’ve agreed on. Not only does this help structure your work, it can also serve as a great reminder for when I inevitably contradict my past self.
* Help others, collaborate and share your ideas and skills. 
* Engage fully in research. Our lab is proud of being passionate about science and I expect everyone to work hard and take an active part in the life of the lab.
* Attend lab meetings. I expect everyone to attend as many lab meetings as they can, while recognising there are occasions where that won't be possible.
* Attend WCHN Project Presentations on Friday afternoons.
* Attend seminars within our home departments. I expect everyone to attend at a minimum the WCHN Brain Meeting (Friday pm) and our Consciousness Club seminars (Wednesdays). Beyond this I encourage you to attend the EP seminars (Mondays), the MPC Computational Psychiatry talks (Thursdays) and ICN seminars (Mondays), though recognise that it's not usually possible or wise to spend your whole week listening to talks!
* Regularly check Slack and respond to messages during work hours - this is our primary means of communication within the group.
* Ask questions, admit when you are wrong, and know the limits of your knowledge.

Beyond these baseline expectations, I'm always delighted to hear about new data, new results, new papers, new talks, or anything else you're excited about - put it in Slack or pop in for a chat. 

# I do not expect you to:

* Respond immediately to emails, especially if sent at unusual times. Email is an asynchronous medium, so set your own boundaries (and other fantastic [PhD tips]((https://twitter.com/annegalloway/status/438412389319319552?lang=en)))!
* Work over weekends and holidays. 

# Steve aspires and promises to:

* Provide the best scientific advice he can.
* Support you in your research and career and help you flourish as a scientist and person.
* Respond to questions and give feedback in a timely manner.
  - I aim to respond to emails or Slack messages the same or next day. If something is urgent (e.g. a problem with data collection, a sudden deadline for a grant application) he will usually respond more quickly.
  - I typically meet with everyone weekly or biweekly; these meetings are in the lab calendar. At other times in the week feel free to drop a Slack message for a quick query. On Mondays I might not reply for a while as this is the day I keep free for my own coding projects.
  - Papers require more time because they need extended blocks of time in the day to think and write. The aim is to get papers back to you within 2 weeks, but often it's quicker. If you don’t hear back after that, please do chase as occasionally things do get waylaid.
  - If you need a letter of reference, or other more substantial feedback (eg on a grant application), please give a heads-up a few weeks in advance (e.g. as soon as you know that you’re applying for something). Steve can then block off time to go over your work and give feedback quickly. 
* Create a fun and supportive learning environment.
* Help you form connections with other researchers and write recommendation letters for scholarships, awards, or future positions.
