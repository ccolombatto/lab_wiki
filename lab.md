# The office

The members of our lab sit across multiple sites, each a few minutes walk apart. Some of the team are sat at the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, at 12 Queen Square (also called “The FIL”). The policy at the FIL is that teams are mixed up, so our group is spread over offices on different floors. Many other meetings happen in this building too. The FIL is part of the Institute of Neurology at UCL, and you will have access to a range of talks and events happening throughout the institute.

Others have office space either in the Dept of Experimental Psychology (EP) at 26 Bedford Way or the Max Planck Centre (MPC) for Computational Psychiatry in Russell Square House. Bedford Way has its own cafe and common room, and both EP and the MPC hold regular seminars of interest to our group.

# Hours

Being around the lab builds camaraderie, ensures we’re always learning from and helping each other, and sparks ideas that you usually wouldn’t have by staying home. However a beneﬁt of academia is that the hours and potential for remote working is much more ﬂexible than a regular oﬃce job. This is especially true post-Covid when there is likely to be a natural shift to more regular home working and/or hybrid meetings. At the time of writing (August 2021), this is still being worked out, not just within UCL and our lab, but for companies and businesses everywhere. For now, Steve is happy to let people take their own approach to balancing work location (either home or in the lab). We’ll keep this situation under review, and when meetings (such as Friday seminars, etc) start to resume regularly in person, it is likely that Steve will expect everyone to be in the lab at least 2 key days per week.

On “work” days (i.e. days when you are not on annual leave (A/L)) try to monitor the lab Slack now and then. Slack is our primary medium for all research-related communication. When writing messages to Steve, consider whether others might benefit from the conversation too and post in the relevant open channel (such as #code-tips or #stats).

# Lab meetings

Our lab meetings are usually on a Friday at 1230pm. For now they are held on Zoom, but as soon as is feasible we’ll move back to having in-person meetings with the option to dial in remotely.

# Travel and Conferences

Let Steve know if you want to attend a conference, apply for a (travel) grant, or give a talk - the answer is often yes, but it’s good to discuss well in advance, particularly if funding is needed. Steve will make sure that his travel schedule is in the lab calendar, so that you will know when he is around to meet.

# Annual Leave

We encourage everyone to take holidays and breaks away from the lab. When you do go away, try to switch oﬀ your email – set an out of oﬃce message and remove it from your phone. Take a proper break. To ensure you log your Annual Leave, ensure you ask Steve to sign oﬀ the relevant dates, and add it to the lab calendar so we know who is around and who is away.
