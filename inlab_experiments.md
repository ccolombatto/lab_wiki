# Recruiting participants

We typically use UCL’s SONA system for subject recruitment. Before testing your ﬁrst subjects, ask Steve or the lab manager to help you set up a SONA account, and ensure that you have the right ethics documents and consent forms. **No testing or piloting should take place on a new project without ﬁrst discussing with Steve.**

# Booking testing rooms and scanning slots

The [testing room](http://intranet.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/bookings/week.php) and [scanner](http://intranet.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/bookings/week.php) diaries can be accessed via the [WCHN homepage](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/) or the FIL [Intranet](http://intranet.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/). To book a room, follow the ”How to book Testing Rooms” or the ”How to book Scanning Slots” links on the intranet where you will ﬁnd a link for a template email. Simply ﬁll out the required details and send.

# Cancellation

If you need to cancel slots for either behavioural testing or scanning please remember to make sure to inform the radiographers as soon as possible, to ensure the resource can be freed up for others. **Please ensure that Steve is kept informed if you need to cancel scanning slots for any reason.**
